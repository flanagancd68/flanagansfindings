## Who am I? - _Flanagan_

Hi there - my name is Chris Flanagan.  In a nutshell, I am:

* A growing disciple of ישוע/Jesus for 2/3 of my life
* A blessed husband of an amazing wife and father of two musically talented young adults
* A Bible student and teacher with a passion for Israel and seeking the historical context
* An advancing Hebrew learner
* A strategic thinker with an eye for analytics and detail
 
In my 30-year healthcare career my mission was simple (and this applies to all of life):

  1. Glofiry God in all I do
  2. Always remember the patient comes first
  3. Remove hurdles for my subordinates and customers
  4. Make my boss look good

## What is this about? - _Findings_

This is my personal blog where I write about all of the above!  My goal is to deliver relevant observations and recommendations that will encourage you in your walk with God [Deut 6:5] and in your relationships with others, whether at home, church, or work [Lev 19:18]

>>Mark 28:30 And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 29 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ 


### What is a `Finding`?

My professional career has been spent in healthcare, and most of that for the past 20 years was focused on healthcare auditing, oversight, and monitoring.  In this space, the term `finding` is commonplace.  Doctors use it to describe the results or impressions of testing, treatment, or evaluation.  Auditors use the term to describe the actual state of some item that was tested against a defined standard.  Findings represent what was discovered and, when necessary, are usually accompanied by recommendations for improvement.  A "finding" may be that an item met standard, or a process is in compliance with policy, or a patient has no abnormalities identified.  A finding is simply a recorded observation from an individual qualified to renter an opinion.



I'm glad you're here!
