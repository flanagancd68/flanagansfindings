title: The blessing in a layoff

The picture you see is of Jerusalem's Eastern, or "Golden", Gates.  

After hearing from his advisors that the Jewish/Christian Messiah was prophecied to return to rule from the Temple Mount and enter through these gates^[Read Ezekiel 43:46 for a picture of Jesus Christ we don't often hear in Church.], the "humble" Ottoman ruler, Suileman the Magnificant, had the gates sealed^[Ironically, this sealing may have itself been a fulfillment of prophecy, though it is debated whether the modern gate that is sealed is the same one referenced in Ezekiel 44:1-2. Whether or not it is actually THE gate, at the very leaset, Suileman thought it was.].  Apparently after descending from heaven touching the Mount of Olives, Suileman didn't think much of Messiah's capabilities.  Safe to say, Suileman didn't know Messiah very well.

So why am I leading off a post about a layoff with talking about some closed gates? 

Our natural reaction when facing a layoff or (or anything that unexpectedly disrupts our lives) is to feel like we're standing in front of a gate that has just been sealed shut.  We're trying to pass through but someone without our prior knowledge has closed that door.  Most companies also make the day of notification the last day worked, and in some cases make it a practice to escort the suddenly terminated employee off the premises.  While companies have valid reasons for doing this, it only adds to the feeling of helplessness and loss of control for the employee by denying him or her the chance to say goodbye to colleagues.

On January 22, I was let go by my company where I had spent the last 19 years in Director and Vice-president positions.  

Friends and colleagues called me expecting me to be downcast or angry but I simply wasn't.  In fact, I had a sense of renewal and optimism.

In my case, I saw the event coming and in many respects was ready to move on anyway. In looking at it from their perspective, I fully understood that it was a business decision and nothing personal. It was a great place to work and I made a lot of friends over the years.  Even with this perspective, a lot of my friends noted how well I seemed to be taking everything.  One said it seemed "unnatural."  He was right!


>Philippians 4:7 Â  And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.


My former company generously provides an outplacement service for their ex-employes to work through this transition.  Much of their material focuses on getting over the shock, trauma, and grief of a job loss.  Grief is natural.  Seeing a closed door (or gate) is natural, at least until the stages of grief progress to acceptance.

I had just about everyone tell me who had gone through it that getting a layoff notice, though scary and painful, was among the best things that had ever happened to them.

I have full confidence that God will use this event for good.  Whatever trials you may be facing, you can have that same optimism.  I encourage you to stay faithful and continue to lean on Him instead of your own understanding.  

The open gates in your life that you didn't think could ever be unsealed just might surprise you!

What man sees as an obstacle, God does not.
