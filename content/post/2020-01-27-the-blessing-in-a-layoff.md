The picture you see is of Jerusalem's Eastern, or "Golden", Gates.  After hearing from his advisors that the Jewish/Christian Messiah was prophecied to return to rule from the Temple Mount and enter through these gates^[Read Ezekiel 43:46 for a picture of Jesus Christ we don't often hear in Church.], the "humble"" Ottoman ruler, Suileman the Magnificant, had the gates sealed^[Ironically, this sealing may have itself been a fulfillment of prophecy, though it is debated whether the modern gate that is sealed is the same one referenced in Ezekiel 44:1-2. Whether or not it is actually THE gate, at the very leaset, Suileman thought it was.].  Apparently after descending from heaven touching the Mount of Olives, Suileman didn't think much of Messiah's capabilities.  Safe to say, Suileman didn't know Messiah very well.

So why am I leading off a post about a layoff with talking about some closed gates? The answer is that I think our natural reaction, whether it's a layoff or something similar that disrupts our lives, is to feel like we're standing in front of a gate that has just been sealed shut.  

On January 22, I was let go by my company where I had spent the last 19 years in Director and Vice-president positions.  In my case, I saw the event coming and in many respects was ready to move on anyway. Despite 

My former company generously provides an outplacement service for their ex-employes to work through this transition.  Much of their material focuses on getting over the shock, trauma, and grief of a job loss.  Grief is natural.  Seeing a closed door (or gate) is natural.

  Most of all I know that God will use this event for good.  What man sees as an obstacle, God does not.  In His strength, the 16" of brick and morter sealing the Eastern Gates will not be a problem.
